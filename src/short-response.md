# Short Responses

For this assessment, aim to write a response with the following qualities:

- [ ] Addresses all parts of the prompt
- [ ] Accurately uses relevant technical terminology

For each prompt below, write your response in the space provided. Aim to answer each prompt in 2-5 concise sentences. Make sure to preview your markdown to check how it is rendered before submitting.

## Prompt 1

Consider the code below which has a bug. Instead of printing the correct letter grade, it always prints `"Your grade is: undefined"`.

```js
const getLetterGrade = (score) => {
  let letter;
  if (score >= 90) {
    let letter = "A";
  } else if (score >= 80) {
    let letter = "B";
  } else if (score >= 70) {
    let letter = "C";
  } else {
    let letter = "F";
  }

  return "Your grade is: " + letter;
};

console.log(getLetterGrade(95)); // This should print "Your grade is: A"
console.log(getLetterGrade(82)); // This should print "Your grade is: B"
console.log(getLetterGrade(74)); // This should print "Your grade is: C"
console.log(getLetterGrade(65)); // This should print "Your grade is: F"
```

**Part A**: Explain why this bug is occurring. Use proper technical terminology.

**Part B**: Then, explain how you would fix it.

### Response 1

**Part A:**

The let keyword within each if/else if block causes variable shadowing, which results in the error.

**Part B:**

Fixing this is pretty simple all you need to do is assign the letter variables in the if blocks to the global scope variable. To do this all we need to do is remove "let" from all the if blocks.

## Prompt 2

Read the following code:

```js
const originalSettings = { volume: 50, brightness: 80 };
const newSettings = originalSettings;
newSettings.volume = 75;
console.log(originalSettings.volume);
```

**Part A:** What will be logged to the console? Why does this happen? Be sure to use precise technical terminology in your answer.

**Part B:** How would you modify the code so that changing `newSettings.volume` does NOT affect `originalSettings.volume`? Write the corrected code below your explanation.

### Response 2

**Part A:**

75 will be logged to the console because objects in JS are reference types, so when you do `const newSettings = orignalSettings;` it doesn't create a copy of orignal settings into new settings, rather it is using the refrence in the memory from the original settings. That's why when we try to modify new settings it will modify the same object, so when `newSettings.volume` is changed to 15 `orignalSettings.volume` is also changed to 15.
**Part B:**

I would modify this code by making a true copy of the object, I can do this by using the spread operator.

**Corrected Code:**

```js
// Fix this code so newSettings is a true copy
const originalSettings = { volume: 50, brightness: 80 };
const newSettings = { ...originalSettings }; // <-----
newSettings.volume = 75;
console.log(originalSettings.volume);
```

## Prompt 3

Given this array of products and the code using `filter`:

```js
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 1000, inStock: true },
  { name: "Phone", price: 700, inStock: false },
  { name: "Watch", price: 300, inStock: true },
  { name: "Tablet", price: 500, inStock: true },
];

const itemsInStock = products.filter((product) => {
  return product.inStock;
});
```

Walk through what happens in the first iteration of filter:

- What is the value of `product`?
- What gets returned from the callback?
- What happens with that returned value?

### Response 3

In the first iteration of filter the value of product is the first element in the product object so it would be ` { name: "Laptop", price: 1000, inStock: true }`, the callback returns true since `product.inStock` for laptop is `true`. Then the returned value is kept and added to the new array.
